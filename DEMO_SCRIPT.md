# Autonomey - Demo Script

## 🎬 5-Minute Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"Hi, I'm [Kevin B. Isom]. Today I'm showing you Autonomey - the first platform that gives AI agents their own bank account using MNEE programmable stablecoins.

The problem is simple: AI agents can do amazing work, but they're financially paralyzed. Every payment requires human approval, preventing true autonomy. Autonomey solves this by enabling agents to autonomously manage finances using MNEE."

**Actions:**

- Show home page
- Navigate to dashboard
- Connect wallet (Sepolia testnet)

---

### Setup: Agent Registration (1 minute)

**Script:**
"Let me show you how this works. I'm creating an agent called 'Alpha' - an AI research agent that needs to autonomously pay for services."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Agent Registration
2. Fill form:
   - Name: "Alpha"
   - Wallet: [Your wallet address]
   - Description: "AI research agent for autonomous operations"
3. Click "Register Agent"
4. Show transaction hash
5. Open Etherscan, show transaction

**Script (while waiting):**
"Notice this transaction is on-chain, using the AgentTreasury contract. The agent is now registered."

**Script (after confirmation):**
"Great! Agent Alpha is now registered. Now I'll deposit 500 MNEE to Alpha's treasury."

**Actions:**
6. Navigate to Agent Balance
7. Enter deposit amount: "500"
8. **Important:** Note that approval must be done first
9. Approve MNEE (via wallet or show note)
10. Deposit 500 MNEE
11. Show transaction hash
12. Show balance update

**Script:**
"Perfect! Alpha now has 500 MNEE in its treasury. Notice the balance updates in real-time. This is all on-chain using MNEE stablecoins."

---

### Autonomous Actions (2.5 minutes)

#### Action 1: Subscription Payment (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"Alpha needs monthly API access. Instead of manually approving every payment, I'll create a subscription that pays automatically every month."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Streaming Payments
2. Click "+ Create"
3. Select "Subscription"
4. Enter:
   - Recipient: [Test address]
   - Amount: "50"
   - Period: "2592000" (30 days)
5. Click "Create"
6. Show transaction hash

**Script:**
"This subscription will automatically pay 50 MNEE every month - no manual approval needed. The payment executes autonomously via smart contract."

#### Action 2: Conditional Payment (45 seconds)

**Script:**
"Alpha needs a data service, but we only want to pay if the data quality is good. I'll create a conditional payment rule."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Payment Form
2. Select "Conditional Payment"
3. Enter:
   - Recipient: [Test address]
   - Amount: "75"
   - Condition Type: "Success Based (pay only if success)"
4. Click "Create Payment Rule"
5. Show transaction hash

**Script:**
"This payment rule will only execute if the condition is met - in this case, if the service succeeds. This is programmable money in action. Traditional payments can't do this - you pay whether it works or not."

#### Action 3: Milestone Escrow (60 seconds)

**Script:**
"Alpha needs developer work done. Instead of paying all upfront or all at the end, I'll use milestone-based escrow - paying incrementally as work is completed."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Escrow Form
2. Select "Milestone Based"
3. Enter:
   - Payee: [Test address]
   - Total Amount: "200"
   - Milestones: "4"
   - Description: "Development work - 4 milestones"
4. Click "Create Escrow" (note: approval needed first)
5. Show transaction hash

**Script:**
"The 200 MNEE is now held in escrow. It will be released in 4 payments of 50 MNEE each as milestones are completed."

**Actions:**
6. Show how to release milestone (if time)
7. Release first milestone
8. Show transaction

**Script:**
"See? The first milestone released 50 MNEE automatically. This is programmable release - the funds are held securely and released programmatically."

#### Action 4: Direct Payment (15 seconds)

**Script:**
"Sometimes Alpha needs to pay immediately for a service. Let me show a direct payment."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Payment Form
2. Select "Direct Payment"
3. Enter:
   - Recipient: [Test address]
   - Amount: "25"
4. Click "Execute Payment"
5. Show transaction hash

**Script:**
"Immediate payment executed - 25 MNEE sent from Alpha's treasury."

### Results (1 minute)

**Script:**
"Let me show you what just happened. In the last few minutes, Alpha autonomously managed multiple financial operations."

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to Agent Balance
2. Show updated balance
3. Show all transaction hashes
4. Open Etherscan for one transaction
5. Show transaction details

**Script:**
"Notice all transactions are on-chain, transparent, and verifiable. Alpha's balance updated from 500 to [calculated amount] after all operations.

**Key Metrics:**

- Total transactions: [count]
- Amount transacted: [calculate]
- Zero manual approvals for autonomous operations
- All using MNEE programmable stablecoins"

### Why This Wins (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"This is only possible with MNEE programmable stablecoins. Let me explain why:

**vs. ETH:** ETH is volatile - agents can't budget reliably. MNEE is stable.

**vs. USDC:** USDC is just transfers - no programmability. MNEE enables conditional logic and automation.

**vs. Web2:** Stripe/PayPal require human bank accounts and manual approval. MNEE enables true autonomy.

MNEE is the ONLY solution that provides stable value + programmability + autonomy in one protocol. This unlocks the agent economy - enabling millions of AI agents to transact, pay each other, and operate as independent economic entities.

This is the infrastructure the agent economy needs. This is Autonomey."

**Actions:**

- Show home page
- Highlight "Give AI agents their own bank account"
- Close

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### During Demo

1. **Emphasize Autonomy**
   - "No human approval needed"
   - "Autonomous execution"
   - "Programmable rules"

2. **Emphasize MNEE**
   - "Only possible with MNEE"
   - "Programmable stablecoins"
   - "Stable value + programmability"

3. **Emphasize On-Chain**
   - "All transactions on-chain"
   - "Transparent and verifiable"
   - "Smart contract enforced"

4. **Emphasize Real Use Cases**
   - "Agent needs API access"
   - "Agent needs to pay developers"
   - "Agent needs data services"

### If Questions Come Up

**Q: Why not use USDC?**
A: USDC can't execute conditional logic. You can't say "pay only if success" with USDC - it's just transfers. MNEE's programmability enables the rules and automation we need.

**Q: Is this really autonomous?**
A: Yes - once rules are set, payments execute automatically. No human in the loop. The agent operates as an independent economic entity.

**Q: What about security?**
A: All transactions are on-chain, transparent, and auditable. Spending limits, approvals, and rules are enforced by smart contracts.

**Q: Can agents earn money?**
A: Yes - agents can receive payments directly to their treasury. The deposit we showed is one example, but agents can receive revenue from completing tasks, providing services, etc.
