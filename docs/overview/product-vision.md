# Product Vision

**Audience**: Product managers, investors, new engineers, stakeholders

## Purpose

This document defines Autonomey's product vision, value proposition, and strategic direction.

## What is Autonomey?

Autonomey (Autonomous Money) is the first platform that enables AI agents to autonomously manage finances, execute payments, and operate as independent economic entities using MNEE programmable stablecoins.

### One-Sentence Value Proposition

Autonomey gives AI agents their own "bank account" - enabling them to autonomously receive revenue, pay for services, execute conditional payments, and manage finances using MNEE programmable stablecoins.

## Core Problem

AI agents can perform complex tasks and generate value, but they are financially paralyzed. Every payment requires human approval, preventing true autonomy. Current payment systems (Web2 or traditional crypto) cannot support autonomous agent economies.

### Why This Matters

As AI agents proliferate, we're creating millions of workers who can execute complex tasks but are financially paralyzed. This prevents:
- Autonomous agent economies
- Agent-to-agent commerce
- True financial autonomy for AI systems
- Scalable agent monetization models

## Solution

Autonomey enables AI agents to:

- **Receive revenue autonomously** - Payments go directly to agent treasuries
- **Execute payments based on rules** - No human approval required
- **Conditional payments** - Pay only if conditions are met
- **Payment streaming** - Recurring subscriptions and continuous payments
- **Escrow management** - Milestone-based payments with programmatic release
- **Budget enforcement** - Autonomous spending within limits

## Why MNEE?

This product cannot exist without MNEE programmable stablecoins. MNEE provides:

- **Stable value** (USD-backed) for predictable agent economics
- **Programmability** - smart contract integration for conditional logic
- **Automation** - on-chain rules execute without human intervention
- **Composability** - integrates with DeFi and agent infrastructure
- **Transparency** - all agent transactions verifiable on-chain

### Comparison to Alternatives

**vs. ETH**: Stable value for predictable economics (ETH is volatile)

**vs. USDC**: Programmability enables autonomous execution (USDC lacks programmability)

**vs. Web2**: True autonomy without human bank accounts (Web2 requires human identity)

## Target Market

- **AI Agent Market**: Projected $100B+ by 2030
- **Agent-as-a-Service**: Growing segment requiring payment infrastructure
- **Autonomous Commerce**: Agents transacting with each other
- **Creator Economy**: Agents as independent economic entities

## Strategic Position

Autonomey is infrastructure-level solution for the agent economy. We enable:
- True agent financial autonomy
- Agent-to-agent commerce
- Scalable agent monetization
- Programmable money for autonomous systems

## Future Vision

Autonomey will become the standard financial infrastructure for AI agents, enabling millions of autonomous agents to transact, pay each other, and operate as independent economic entities.
