## Why Archived?

These files contained:
- Duplicate information
- Status tracking (temporary)
- Redundant explanations
- Mixed concerns (deployment + testing in one file)

The new structure provides:
- Single source of truth
- Clear separation of concerns
- Enterprise-grade organization
- Better discoverability
